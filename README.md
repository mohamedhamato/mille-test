### P.S
i didnt use any css in js or styled components so there`s so many options in the components   

i also didn`t use context api or redux i pass the data from parent to child as props because the data is so small  

i used next js to generate seo friendly template with static pages 

i import fonts in the header also the material icons didn`t use npm
